# Definitions

Monetization:
Monetization includes, but is not limited to, receiving any form of revenue, direct or indirect,
as a result of the Software’s presence or use.

1. Grant of License
   Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person (the "User") obtaining a copy of
   this software (the "Software"), to use, modify, and distribute the Software, subject to the
   following conditions:
   1.1 Code Use:
   You can only use our source code for public mods if you get permission from @yajat_kaul
   Himself. And You can only use the Showdown Changes as well only if you get permission
   from @treynamitv.
   1.2 Commercial Use
   The use of any part of the Mega Showdown Software—including but not limited to code,
   assets, textures, models, or derivatives thereof—for any commercial purpose is strictly
   prohibited. This includes, without limitation:
   ● Selling or licensing the Software or its components;
   ● Using the Software or its components in paid mods, paid access content, or premium
   features;
   ● Locking any content derived from the Software (such as skins, textures, or features)
   behind paywalls, donation rewards, server crate keys, or other monetized systems.
   Commercial use is defined as any activity that results in direct or indirect financial gain,
   regardless of whether the gain is monetary or in-kind (e.g., through donations, subscriptions,
   ad revenue, or exclusive access). Any exception must be explicitly authorized in writing by
   Yajat Kaul.
   1.3 Modification & Redistribution
   You are permitted to create and distribute sidemods—that is, separate modules, extensions,
   or addons that interact with Mega Showdown but do not contain substantial portions of its
   original code—without requesting permission, and such sidemods are not bound by
   the Mega Showdown License, provided they do not include, copy, or heavily derive from
   Mega Showdown source files.
   However, if your modification or derivative work includes significant sections of code,
   logic, or structure from the Mega Showdown Software—such as major systems, gameplay
   features, or internal engine components—then you must obtain explicit written
   permission from Yajat Kaul before distributing or publishing the work in any form.
   Redistribution of any portion of the original Mega Showdown Software, whether modified or
   unmodified, on public platforms (e.g., Modrinth, CurseForge) requires prior written
   approval, and must include:
   ● Clear credit to the original author(s), and
   ● An intact copy of this license file.
   1.4 Texture/Asset Use:
   All textures, models, animations, audio, and other visual or design assets that are original to
   and exclusively created for Mega Showdown are licensed under the Creative Commons
   Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) license.
   Under this license:
   ● You may not use these assets for any commercial purpose, including but not limited
   to selling them, including them in monetized projects, or using them in
   donation-based or paywalled content.
   ● You must provide appropriate credit to the original authors when using or sharing
   these assets.
   ● If you remix, adapt, or build upon the assets, you must distribute your contributions
   under the same CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.
   ● Redistribution of the assets outside of the Software must clearly state that they
   originate from Mega Showdown and include a link to this license.
   Use of these assets in any context outside Mega Showdown must still comply with this
   license unless explicit, written permission is granted by Yajat Kaul.
2. Liability & Warranty Disclaimer
   The Software is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express or implied. The
   author shall not be held liable for any damages, including but not limited to data loss, server
   failures, or other issues resulting from the modification of the Software or from the use of
   modified copies of the Software.
3. License Coverage
   Any and all versions of the Software released prior to June 22, 2025, are licensed under the
   CC-BY-NC-SA license.
   This license (Mega Showdown License 2.0) applies only to versions released on or after
   June 22, 2025.
4. Intellectual Property Rights
   All models, animations, and textures included in the Software remain the intellectual property
   of their original authors, all of which have given their explicit consent for their assets to be
   used. This license does not grant ownership or redistribution rights over these assets
   beyond the terms explicitly stated herein.
5. Saving Clause
   If any provision of this License is found to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable for any reason,
   then that provision shall be deemed severable from this License and shall not affect the
   validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. The remaining terms shall continue in
   full force and effect as if the unenforceable portion had never been included. In cases where
   a clause requires revision to be enforceable, it shall be interpreted or reformed to the
   minimum extent necessary to make it valid while preserving the original intent of the clause.
